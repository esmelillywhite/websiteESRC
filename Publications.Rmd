**Abstract:**

School absenteeism is detrimental to life course outcomes and is known to be socioeconomically stratified.  However, the link between socioeconomic status (SES) and school absence is complex given the multidimensional nature of both family SES (e.g., income, education, occupational status) and absenteeism (e.g., truancy, sickness, suspension).  Despite the vast literature on socioeconomic inequalities in school attendance, no systematic review on SES and school absenteeism exists.  This study systematically reviewed and provides a narrative synthesis of journal articles (n = 55) published between 1998 to 2019 on the association between SES dimensions and forms of absenteeism.  The majority of studies from high-income contexts found an association between SES and absenteeism in the expected direction, albeit on average with small effect sizes.  Studies largely confirmed these findings among populations at risk of school absence and those from low- and middle-income countries.  There was greater evidence for an association between absenteeism and SES measured at the family than the school level.  Studies using SES measures of financial resources (e.g., free or reduced-price lunch) provided more evidence for this association than studies measuring sociocultural resources (e.g., parental education).  There is limited evidence that socioeconomic achievement gaps in absenteeism vary by the reasons for absence. Research on the mediating pathways between SES and absenteeism is sparse.  A key implication is that attempts to address inequalities in educational outcomes must include tackling SES gaps in school attendance.

**Abstract:**

In this article, we investigated whether and to what extent various dimensions of socioeconomic background (parental education, parental class, free school meal registration, housing status, and neighbourhood deprivation) predict overall school absences and different reasons for absenteeism (truancy, sickness, family holidays and temporary exclusion) among 4,620 secondary school pupils in Scotland. Students were drawn from a sample of the Scottish Longitudinal Study comprising linked Census data and administrative school records. Using fractional logit models and logistic regressions, we found that all dimensions of socioeconomic background were uniquely linked to overall absences. Multiple measures of socioeconomic background were also associated with truancy, sickness-related absence, and temporary exclusion. Social housing and parental education had the most pervasive associations with school absences across all forms of absenteeism. Our findings highlight the need to consider the multidimensionality of socioeconomic background in policy and research decisions on school absenteeism. A more explicit focus on narrowing the socioeconomic gap in absenteeism is required to close the inequality gap in educational and post-school outcomes.

**Key points:**

- Absenteeism from school is socially stratified and being absent from school is likely an important contributor to the attainment gap in Scotland. 
- All dimensions of socioeconomic background increased the risk of overall absenteeism from school. 
- Pupils from socially rented households, and households with no qualifications are the most likely to be absent from school, and these factors are consistently associated with all forms of absenteeism (overall, sickness based, truancy, temporary exclusion) except family holidays. 
- The association between socioeconomic background and absenteeism did not vary across gender or place of residence (urban vs rural). 
- It is likely that COVID-19 related school closures will exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities in school attendance. 
- There is an urgent need to address socioeconomic inequalities in school absenteeism

**Key Points:**

- Student absences after the first wave of Covid-19 school closures were higher than in previous years 
- Higher rates of absenteeism after school lockdown were due to COVID-19 related reasons 
- Overall, non-Covid-19-related absence rates are similar to trends observed in earlier years 
- Socioeconomic inequalities in school absenteeism were higher post-lockdown than in previous years 
- This increase can be attributed to rising disparities in school absenteeism due to Covid19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons 
- The rise in socioeconomic inequality in nonCovid-19related absenteeism was not only due to higher absence rates among students from the most deprived areas but also due to lower absence rates among students from the least deprived areas 
- Addressing the disproportionate short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable children needs to be at the forefront of policy agenda 
- We need greater monitoring and evaluation of:
  - inequalities in home learning during the second round of school    closures 
  - inequalities in academic achievement after school reopening 
  - policy interventions designed to mitigate the consequences of Covid-19 on achievement gaps.
