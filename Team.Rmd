<p>**Valentina Perinetti Casoni: **

Valentina Perinetti Casoni holds a Research Associate position at the University of Strathclyde and a Senior Research Associate position at the University of Bristol. She has a BA in International Studies and Diplomacy from the Università degli Studi di Trieste and a Double MSc in Public Policy & Human Development from Maastricht University (MU) and the United Nations University (UNU-MERIT) where she specialised in Social Protection Policy Design and Financing.
At the University of Bristol, she is currently involved in the ESRC-funded BIPE project [BIPE project](https://bipeproject.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) which investigates how students’ socioeconomic background and ethnicity impact on teachers’ views of their attitudes to school and school performance. Valentina’s research aims at producing robust, policy-relevant, quantitative evidence of how educational systems and policies can re-balance or reinforce educational inequalities and social stratification. In particular, she is interested in investigating school-related and classroom-related mechanisms that might exacerbate or reduce differences not just in achievement but also in learning experiences between children of high and low socio-economic status.
