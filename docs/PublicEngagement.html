J, Klein, M., &amp; Sosu, E. (2023) Trajectories of School Absences and
Pupils’ Academic Performance. Research Brief. University of
Strathclyde</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two-thirds of pupils have consistently low absence trajectories,
while one-third demonstrate some form of moderate to high absence
trajectories over the compulsory schooling period.</li>
<li>More than one-fourth of pupils have consistently moderate authorised
absences.</li>
<li>Three smaller groups have moderately increased unauthorised,
strongly increasing authorised, and strongly increasing unauthorised
absences.</li>
<li>All identified absence trajectories have a detrimental impact on
GCSE achievement in year 11, with increasing unauthorised absences
having the most harmful impact.</li>
<li>While extreme levels of unauthorised absences are most detrimental,
a narrow policy focus on this absentee group will miss many students
with other absence trajectories, whose impact is also harmful to
achievement.</li>
<li>The findings emphasise the need for a nuanced approach to combating
absenteeism, including tailored support for students in different
absence trajectory groups.</li>

E., &amp; Lillywhite, E. (2022) School Absenteeism and Educational
Attainment - Evidence from the Scottish Longitudinal Study. Research
Brief. University of Strathclyde</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>School absences are detrimental to educational attainment in
national exams at the end of compulsory (S4) and post-compulsory
schooling (S5/S6) in Scotland.</li>
<li>Truancy, sickness-related absences, and absences due to exceptional
domestic circumstances each have a unique negative impact on educational
attainment at both stages.</li>
<li>Our findings suggest three additional pathways through which absence
may affect academic achievement: a behavioural pathway, a health
pathway, and a psychosocial pathway.</li>
<li>Our research challenges previous assumptions that unexcused absences
are more harmful than excused absences and calls for equal emphasis on
tackling all forms of school absence.</li>
<li>Research and interventions need to focus on mitigating the harmful
consequences of school absenteeism, considering the reason for
absence.</li>

E., &amp; Klein, M. (2021). Socioeconomic disparities in school
absenteeism after the first wave of COVID-19 school closures in
Scotland. Research Brief. University of Strathclyde</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student absences after the first wave of Covid-19 school closures
were higher than in previous years</li>
<li>Higher rates of absenteeism after school lockdown were due to
COVID-19 related reasons</li>
<li>Overall, non-Covid-19-related absence rates are similar to trends
observed in earlier years</li>
<li>Socioeconomic inequalities in school absenteeism were higher
post-lockdown than in previous years</li>
<li>This increase can be attributed to rising disparities in school
absenteeism due to Covid19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons</li>
<li>The rise in socioeconomic inequality in nonCovid-19related
absenteeism was not only due to higher absence rates among students from
the most deprived areas but also due to lower absence rates among
students from the least deprived areas</li>
<li>Addressing the disproportionate short- and long-term impact of the
pandemic on the most vulnerable children needs to be at the forefront of
policy agenda</li>
<li>We need greater monitoring and evaluation of:
<ul>
<li>inequalities in home learning during the second round of school
closures</li>
<li>inequalities in academic achievement after school reopening</li>
<li>policy interventions designed to mitigate the consequences of
Covid-19 on achievement gaps.</li>

M., Goodfellow, C., Dare, S., &amp; Sosu, E. (2020). Socioeconomic
Inequalities in School Attendance in Scotland: Research Brief.
University of Strathclyde.</a></p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absenteeism from school is socially stratified and being absent from
school is likely an important contributor to the attainment gap in
Scotland.</li>
<li>All dimensions of socioeconomic background increased the risk of
overall absenteeism from school.</li>
<li>Pupils from socially rented households, and households with no
qualifications are the most likely to be absent from school, and these
factors are consistently associated with all forms of absenteeism
(overall, sickness based, truancy, temporary exclusion) except family
holidays.</li>
<li>The association between socioeconomic background and absenteeism did
not vary across gender or place of residence (urban vs rural).</li>
<li>It is likely that COVID-19 related school closures will exacerbate
socioeconomic inequalities in school attendance.</li>
<li>There is an urgent need to address socioeconomic inequalities in
school absenteeism.</li>
